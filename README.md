# Aiden and Zoie's Homework Helper

### Small website set up for my kids to practice their homework and school skills

#### Included is Math and Vocabulary practice

- Hangman for vocabulary practice
- Math Games for addition, subtraction, & multiplication
- More to come

## This is deployed using [Surge](https://surge.sh/)

A wonderful and easy web hosting service

### Custom domain `https://aidenshomework.com`

## To deploy use CLI and run a few commands:

Setup:

- `npm install --global surge`
- cd into project directory and simply type `surge`
- It will prompt to setup an account - enter email address
- Enter password
- It will confirm the directory for deployment - just hit enter
- It will then suggest a domain name - either enter or change the name and hit enter

Now that it is all setup with custom domain and CNAME file - to redeploy just run `surge`
